# MessageMedia Messages NodeJS SDK
[![Travis Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/messagemedia/messages-nodejs-sdk.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/messagemedia/messages-nodejs-sdk)

The MessageMedia Messages API provides a number of endpoints for building powerful two-way messaging applications.

## How to Build

The generated SDK relies on [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/) (NPM) being available to resolve dependencies. If you don't already have NPM installed, please go ahead and follow instructions to install NPM from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
The SDK also requires Node to be installed. If Node isn't already installed, please install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
> NPM is installed by default when Node is installed

To check if node and npm have been successfully installed, write the following commands in command prompt:

* `node --version`
* `npm -version`

![Version Check](https://apidocs.io/illustration/nodejs?step=versionCheck&workspaceFolder=MessageMediaMessages-Node)

Now install messagemedia-messages-sdk via npm by using
* `npm install messagemedia-messages-sdk`

Alternatively, add the following to the dependancies section of your package.json
* `"messagemedia-messages-sdk": "^1.0.0"`

## How to Use

The following section explains how to use the library in a new project.

### 1. Open Project Folder
Open an IDE/Text Editor for JavaScript like Sublime Text. The basic workflow presented here is also applicable if you prefer using a different editor or IDE.

Click on `File` and select `Open Folder`.

![Open Folder](https://apidocs.io/illustration/nodejs?step=openFolder)

Select the folder of your SDK and click on `Select Folder` to open it up in Sublime Text. The folder will become visible in the bar on the left.

### 2. Creating a Test File

Now right click on the folder name and select the `New File` option to create a new test file. Save it as `index.js` Now import the generated NodeJS library using the following lines of code:

```js
var sdk = require('messagemedia-messages-sdk');
```

Save changes.

![Save new file](https://apidocs.io/illustration/nodejs?step=saveNewFile&workspaceFolder=MessageMediaMessages-Node)

### 3. Running The Test File

To run the `index.js` file, open up the command prompt and navigate to the Path where the SDK folder resides. Type the following command to run the file:

```
node index.js
```

![Run file](https://apidocs.io/illustration/nodejs?step=runProject&workspaceFolder=MessageMediaMessages-Node)


## How to Test

These tests use Mocha framework for testing, coupled with Chai for assertions. These dependencies need to be installed for tests to run.
Tests can be run in a number of ways:

### Method 1 (Run all tests)

1. Navigate to the root directory of the SDK folder from command prompt.
2. Type `mocha --recursive` to run all the tests.

### Method 2 (Run all tests)

1. Navigate to the `../test/Controllers/` directory from command prompt.
2. Type `mocha *` to run all the tests.

### Method 3 (Run specific controller's tests)

1. Navigate to the `../test/Controllers/` directory from command prompt.
2. Type `mocha  MessagesController`  to run all the tests in that controller file.

> To increase mocha's default timeout, you can change the `TEST_TIMEOUT` parameter's value in `TestBootstrap.js`.

## Initialization

### Authentication
In order to setup authentication in the API client, you need the following information.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| basicAuthUserName | The username to use with basic authentication |
| basicAuthPassword | The password to use with basic authentication |



API client can be initialized as following:

```JavaScript
const sdk = require('messagemedia-messages-sdk');

// Configuration parameters and credentials
sdk.Configuration.basicAuthUserName = "basicAuthUserName"; // The username to use with basic authentication
sdk.Configuration.basicAuthPassword = "basicAuthPassword"; // The password to use with basic authentication

```
